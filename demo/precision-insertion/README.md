# Precision insertion demo

This directory is reserved for an independent precision-insertion demo. Its
runner must not call `src.execution.run_auto.main()` or require edits to the
existing AutoDex execution files (`run_auto.py`, `run_pipeline.py`, or
`scene_cfg.py`). AutoDex/ParaDex hardware and perception APIs may be reused
through explicit adapters, while insertion-specific orchestration lives here.

There is no robot-executable insertion runner in this directory yet. The
existing scenario catalog, VLM observer, and retry policy are offline evidence
and decision helpers, not proof of a continuous insertion plan or hardware
readiness. Do not interpret a grasp/lift simulation pass as an insertion pass.

The path component `precision-insertion` is a directory name, not an importable
Python package name. If helper modules are added, use an importable package
name such as `precision_insertion` inside this directory.
